# Chapter 1: Introduction to F3A

**What is F3A?**  
F3A is a specific class of airplane model recognized by the FAI (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale), the governing body for air sports and aeronautic world records. It falls under the category of Radio-Controlled Precision Aerobatics, where pilots perform prescribed aerobatic maneuvers judged based on precision, accuracy, and execution.

**Where can I find F3A in the USA?**  
F3A, also known as "RC pattern aerobatics" in the USA, is flown by the NSRCA (National Society of Radio Controlled Aerobatics), a special interest group within the AMA (Academy of Model Aeronautics). The NSRCA is responsible for promoting and organizing radio-controlled aerobatic flying events and competitions. For the latest information, visit the NSRCA website (nsrca.us) or check out the AMA's website section on [special interest groups](https://www.modelaircraft.org/about-ama/ama-organization/special-interest-groups).

**Is there an official "F3A Club"?**  
No. At the time of this writing, there is no dedicated "F3A Club" as such. To find specific F3A events organized by NSRCA in the USA, visit the NSRCA website and check their [events calendar](https://nsrca.us/index.php/eventsnewmenu/list-events). Additionally, you can reach out to local aeromodeling clubs in your area that partner with NSRCA to inquire about upcoming F3A events. Please note that event schedules and locations can change, so it's best to regularly check the NSRCA website or get in touch with local clubs for the most up-to-date information on F3A events.


## 1.0.1 Get a simple foam plane with a good power system 

Your RC plane must have enough power to fly a vertical line perpendicular to the horizon.

- NSRCA website recommends a foam plane from FMS [F3A Olympus 1400mm](https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/f3a-olympus-pnp-1400mm/FMM067P2.html)
- Many people already have powerful foamy from E-Flite [Timber X 1.2m](https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/timber-x-1.2m-pnp/EFL3875.html)
- There are good profile ARFs from Twisted Hobbies [42-48" Airfoil Series](https://twistedhobbys.com/airplanes/3d-monoplanes/42-48-airfoild-series/) with [Power Combo 42-48" SKU PC17](https://twistedhobbys.com/power-combo-42-48-mono-models/)

With one of the above planes or any other that you have, practice flying the figure **Cuban 8** as follows:

It does not have to be perfect. If you enjoyed the exercise, you are ready to take a stab at a complete sequence in the next section and make it perfect.

If it is going to be your very first real 2 meter long F3A model, buying a second-hand plane might be a very good option.

To buy it used, you can follow these steps:

1. **Research and Decide:** First, familiarize yourself with F3A model planes and their specifications. Understand the different models available and decide on the specific features you want in the plane.

2. **Online Marketplaces:** Check online marketplaces like eBay, Craigslist, RC forums, or specialized RC trading websites for used F3A model planes. These platforms often have listings for second-hand planes.

3. **Local RC Clubs:** Visit local RC flying clubs or model aircraft events. Many RC enthusiasts participate in these gatherings, and you might find someone looking to sell their F3A model plane.

4. **RC Classifieds:** Look for RC classified ads in RC hobby magazines or websites. Some websites cater specifically to RC enthusiasts and have dedicated classified sections.

5. **Social Media Groups:** Join RC-related social media groups or forums where members might post items for sale. Facebook groups or Reddit communities related to RC flying can be valuable sources.

6. **Contact Sellers:** Once you find a used F3A model plane that interests you, get in touch with the seller. Inquire about the condition of the plane, its history, any modifications or repairs, and request pictures if possible.

7. **Inspect and Verify:** If you are buying locally, arrange to meet the seller and inspect the model plane in person. Check for any damages or wear and ensure it meets your requirements.

8. **Negotiate and Finalize:** Negotiate the price with the seller based on the condition of the plane and its accessories. If you agree on the price, finalize the deal and arrange the payment method.

9. **Shipping or Pickup:** If the plane is not local, discuss shipping options with the seller. Ensure safe packaging and appropriate shipping methods to avoid any damage during transit.

10. **Be Cautious:** When buying a used RC model plane, exercise caution, and make sure to trust the seller. If possible, ask for references or feedback from previous buyers to validate the seller's credibility.

Remember, F3A model planes can be quite valuable, so take your time to find the right one that suits your needs and budget. Inspect the plane thoroughly, ask questions, and ensure a smooth transaction before making the purchase.

Happy flying!
