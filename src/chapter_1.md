# Chapter 1: Introduction to F3A

**What is F3A?**  
F3A is a specific class of airplane model recognized by the FAI (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale), the governing body for air sports and aeronautic world records. It falls under the category of Radio-Controlled Precision Aerobatics, where pilots perform prescribed aerobatic maneuvers judged based on precision, accuracy, and execution.

**Where can I find F3A in the USA?**  
F3A, also known as "RC pattern aerobatics" in the USA, is flown by the NSRCA (National Society of Radio Controlled Aerobatics), a special interest group within the AMA (Academy of Model Aeronautics). The NSRCA is responsible for promoting and organizing radio-controlled aerobatic flying events and competitions. For the latest information, visit the NSRCA website (nsrca.us) or check out the AMA's website section on [special interest groups](https://www.modelaircraft.org/about-ama/ama-organization/special-interest-groups).

**Is there an official "F3A Club"?**  
No. At the time of this writing, there is no dedicated "F3A Club" as such. To find specific F3A events organized by NSRCA in the USA, visit the NSRCA website and check their [events calendar](https://nsrca.us/index.php/eventsnewmenu/list-events). Additionally, you can reach out to local aeromodeling clubs in your area that partner with NSRCA to inquire about upcoming F3A events. Please note that event schedules and locations can change, so it's best to regularly check the NSRCA website or get in touch with local clubs for the most up-to-date information on F3A events in the USA.
